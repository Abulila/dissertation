\caption{\textbf{Buffer execution under relaxed persistent consistency.}  Relaxing persistent consistency removes unnecessary cross-thread dependencies (as in LPO), allows epochs to persist in parallel (as in PEO), and removes unnecessary serial epoch dependencies within threads (top).  Epochs/dependencies are elided by persisting only select counter values (bottom).}
