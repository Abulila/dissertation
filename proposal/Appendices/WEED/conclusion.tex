\section{Conclusion}
To enable holistic research on data center energy efficiency, computer system designers need models to enable reasoning about total data center power draw.  We have presented parametric power models of data center components suitable for use in a detailed data center simulation infrastructure and for abstract back-of-the-envelope estimation.  We demonstrate the utility of these models through case studies of several hypothetical data center designs.
