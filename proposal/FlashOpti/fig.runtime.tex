\caption{\textbf{Join performance.}  Join runtimes on Flash SSD and Disk, normalized for each join to the runtime of sort-merge on disk.  Though there is significant variability in join algorithm performance on disk, performance variability on SSD is dwarfed by the  6\texttimes~performance advantage of moving data from disk to SSD.}
