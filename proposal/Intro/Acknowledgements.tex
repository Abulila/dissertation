Completing a Ph.D. is a long, daunting process, and I could not have succeeded without help from many people.
I would first like to thank my close friends and family for all their support, especially my parents; my sister, Carolyn; and Christie Ferguson.
Next I would like to thank my collaborators and advisors for teaching by example, especially my dissertation advisor, Tom Wenisch; James VanGilder; Jack Underwood; Partha Ranganathan; Jichuan Chang; Kristen LeFevre; Brian Gold; Bill Bridge; and Peter Chen.
Thank you to all of my lab mates and department friends who assisted me with projects, listened to my problems over coffee, released steam playing basketball, or procrastinated with a game of Starcraft, including David Meisner, Mark Woh, Ben Cassell, Dan Fabbri, Timur Alperovich, Aasheesh Kolli, Richard Sampson, Prateek Tandon, Neha Agarwal, Jeff Rosen, and Korey Sewell.
Finally, thank you to everyone else in the department, Trevor Mudge's lab across the hall, Scott Mahlke's lab next door, the ACAL reading group, and everyone attending my defense.
