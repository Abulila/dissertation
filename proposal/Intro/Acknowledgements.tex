Completing a Ph.D. is a long, daunting process, and I could not have succeeded without help from many people.
I would first like to thank my close friends and family for all their support, especially my parents; my sister, Carolyn; and Christie Ferguson.
Next I would like to thank my collaborators, advisors, and committee for teaching by example, especially my dissertation advisor, Tom Wenisch; James VanGilder; Jack Underwood; Partha Ranganathan; Jichuan Chang; Kristen LeFevre; Brian Gold; Bill Bridge; Peter Chen; Mike Cafarella; and Zhengya Zhang.
Thank you to all of my lab mates and department friends who assisted me with projects, listened to my problems over coffee, released steam playing basketball, or procrastinated with a game of Starcraft, including David Meisner, Faissal Sleiman, Mark Woh, Ben Cassell, Dan Fabbri, Timur Alperovich, Aasheesh Kolli, Richard Sampson, Prateek Tandon, Neha Agarwal, and Jeff Rosen.
Finally, thank you to everyone else in the department, Trevor Mudge's lab across the hall, Scott Mahlke's lab next door, the ACAL reading group, and everyone attending my defense.
