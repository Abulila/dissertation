============

My Ph.D. dissertation source

forms: forms I filled out and submitted when defending.  Please retrieve up-to-date forms from Rackham.
rackham_template: LaTeX template taken from http://aoss.engin.umich.edu/pages/current/dissertation-template
proposal: actual dissertation.  Final version edited on top of proposal.

The repos contains both my thesis proposal and dissertation.  Check out the lastest version for the dissertation.
Check out commit 6ea42b0a189cb569906bc42eeb854d10fc5ba635 for the proposal version.

Note: the had issues with many new LaTeX packages alongside the rackham template.  I opted to just use old (deprecated) packages.  For example, I use the subfigure packages, which has been replaced by subfig (which was in turn replaced by subcaption).
Also keep in mind that the dissertation formatting guidelines are subject to change and they specifically instruct you not to use another student's dissertation as a template.
Therefore, this thesis is offered with no promises, either that you will be able to get your LaTeX to play nice with the styles used, nor that this will even provide the correct formatting.
